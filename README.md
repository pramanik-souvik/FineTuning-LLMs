# FineTuning-LLMs
## Fine tuning some LLMs for text classification of Bengali movie review dataset.

### We have finetuned the LLM models for a specific Dataset which were collected from kaggle.
The models we fine tuned are:
                  - BERT model (bert-base-uncased)
                  - Llama 3.1 8B (meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
                  - Llama 3.2 1B (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B)
                  - RoBERTa model (FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-base)
                  - DeBERTa model (lucadiliello/deberta-small)
